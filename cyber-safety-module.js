A lot of things are different now - there's so much homework, the classes are really hard, and it feels like everything is a lot more serious than it was in middle school. In fact, the whole month has been a little stressful.

Now that she's done with school for the day she wants to do something to relax. She could check her Instagram feed, watch Stranger Things, or see if there are any new Snap Stories.

She's pretty good at art and likes posting her work for everyone to see. Last night she posted a [[picture]] of her most recent drawing and she's excited to see how many comments and likes it got. 

A couple people liked it, but this girl Maddie commented "Wow...so bad... #needsdrawinglessons"

Really? Who does that? 

How should Jess respond?

[[Ignore it]]

She just feels like watching a few dozen episodes of Stranger Things before she starts her homework. She gets in bed and pulls out her laptop. Halfway through the episode she gets a [[text]] from a random number. The person says they're Ryan, a boy from her english class. Ryan is funny - a total class clown, but he also seems smart and is friends with pretty much everyone.

what should she do?

Most of them are pretty boring today, but she sees a snap from Olivia, one of her friends since middle school. Olivia hardly ever uses snapchat, but today she's snapped a [[selfie]] of herself and another friend.  

It's really annoying because Jess asked Olivia if she could hangout this afternoon and she said she had to do homework today.

What should Jess do?

[[Creep]] on Olivia's Instagram to see who her new friend is

Why would Olivia lie about doing homework? Her new friends looks pretty cool. Jess wonders how they met.

Jess and Olivia pretty much have the same friend group, but she's never seen this mystery friend. She's a little jealous that Olivia didn't invite her to get coffee, but she's also kind of embarrassed that she feels that way - Olivia's allowed to have other friends, right?

Still, Jess can't stop thinking about who this person is. She logs onto her instagram account and starts scrolling through her feed to see what's new. There's a post of Olivia and her new friend. She sees that the friend has been tagged and goes to her profile. Jess is really surprised to see there are [[pictures]] of her drinking alcohol - what kind of idiot would post that?

She also notices that this girl has like a thousand followers. Jess has never been worried about followers, but something about seeing so many makes her jealous.

What should Jess do?

Figure out how to get [[more followers]]

This is kind of weird - Jess hardly ever gets texts from people she doesn't know. There is a guy named Ryan in one of her classes, but who would have given him her number?

Jess usually doesn't text back if she doesn't recognize the number. Besides, she'd rather relax than talk to someone right now.

The next day at school Ryan comes up to Jess and asks her why she never responded to his text. Jess tells him that she was busy last night and didn't check her phone - she didn't want to get into the rules she has about answering texts from people she doesn't know.

During class Jess and Ryan start texting. Ryan is hilarious, but his jokes start to get more and more mean. He starts making fun of this guy in class name Sam. He sends [[a picture]] he's photoshopped of him. 

The picture is funny, but Jess knows that making fun of people is wrong. At the same time she is really enjoying talking to Ryan and doesn't want to ruin the mood. What should Jess do?

She tells him [[no->text5]] and he starts to get pushy. It's probably time to block Ryan.

Jess sends a picture of herself to Ryan. Later that night she gets [[a text]] from Olivia.

Oh my god! This is so embarrassing! How many people saw that picture she sent to Ryan?

Jess is mortified. She really doesn't want anyone - especially - her parents to find out she was sexting. What can she do?

He got really [[mad]] and started texting her. It was kind of scary - it seems like Ryan is unstable. Jess thinks it's a good idea to block his number.  

She also went through all of her social media accounts and blocked Ryan. There's still the question of whether or not Jess should report Ryan.

What should she do?

Maddie is being so mean. She's even been posting pictures of people without their permission. [[This one]] got a lot of attention. Indira, the girl in the picture, is a little weird and doesn't have many friends, but she's nice - besides, no one should be bullied.

She only makes a few comments, but soon people are messaging Jess telling her how hilarious she is. It seems like Maddie had a lot of people who didn't like her. It feels pretty good to be getting all these texts. Jess has never been popular, but this is what she imagines it must be like. 

As she's falling asleep, Jess feels a little guilty, but at the same time she feels like Maddie deserves it. 

The next day at school Maddie is being her same old self. A part of Jess thought that if Maddie saw what it was like to be bullied she might stop.

This cannot be happening. Why would Ryan share those pictures?! Jess though that only happened when people made each other mad - she hasn't done anything to Ryan!

Jess feels good about what she did. For Indira, It really helped to have someone check in. She made a great point about reporting cyberbullying. Maddie is mean to a lot of people. Indira was ok, but what about everyone else?

He [[invites->texting]] Jess to go to a thrift shop downtown. He says that you can find some great stuff there. Plus, it's only a few minutes from Jess's house.

She doesn't say anything and decides to [[go inside]] the store. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="go inside" tags="" position="2421,2016">Jess goes inside the store and calls her dad to come pick her up. When she gets home she decides to tell her dad about what happened. 

They both agree that she shouldn't approve requests from people she doesn't know. Jess feels really weird about what happened. She didn't know who that man was that leaned out of the window. She guesses it could have been Liron's dad, but the whole experience made her feel uncomfortable. 

Shortly afterwards she gets a [[text->angryliron]] from Liron. 

Everything about this seems weird. Jess doesn't respond to his text, but then she gets a [[DM]] on instagram from him. 

She decides to block his number and go through her social media accounts to make sure he isn't following her. 

Jess makes a report, which hopefully will mean the end of her interaction Liron. She doesn't know much about him, but she does know his accounts and provided a description of Liron's "dad."

Maddie didn't seem to care, but at least Jess stood up for something. Maybe Maddie will think twice before posting next time. 

Jess goes back to scrolling through her instagram feed, but within ten minutes she sees Maddie has posted a [[gif]] of a track team member messing up at the last competition.

A couple people liked it, but this girl Maddie commented "Wow...so bad... #needsdrawinglessons"

She was sexting with her boyfriend, but now that they're broken up, he keeps threatening to expose her. This is terrible! even Maddie doesn't deserve that kind of stress.

Their Twitter beefs are legendary.

It's pretty obvious that Maddie is trying to spread the video around to embarrass her. Jess decides to make a post calling Maddie out. Since Maddie's main goal is to embarrass people, Jess thinks everyone should remember the time Maddie slipped in the cafeteria and dropped her food all over herself. She also encourages everyone else to post their favorite memories of Maddie being stupid. 

People go crazy over this. Messages and hilarious stories pour in. It seems like there are hundreds of people who hate Maddie. Jess logs out for the evening - satisfied that justice has been served.

The next day at school Maddie doesn't show up. This makes Jess feel a little nervous - is Maddie sick? Did she do something serious? Was Jess being a cyber bully?

Sam isn't very popular, but he's really friendly. He kind of has a lazy eye and just the slightest unibrow, which makes this photoshop accurate, but also really, really cruel.

She googles how to get more followers and ends up on this website called likestagram. 

It's advertising this bot that will go through and like posts and pictures. The more pictures you like, the more likely you are to get new followers. It seems like a really good idea!

Should Jess use the like bot?

A few hours later she checks her profile and sees just a few follower request. She's pretty bummed, but a few is better than none. She accepts the request and puts Stranger Things on in the background while she thinks about how to get more followers. 

Soon her phone vibrates. She's gotten a DM request from the follower she accepted.

Jess accepts the request, but now really [[wishes she hadn't]].

She tells her dad that she deleted her accounts, but continues to use them when he's not around. She feels really guilty, but his punishment was completely unfair. 

A few days later Jess gets into a fight with this girl she knows from school named Maddie. Maddie is really annoying. She posts a lot about other people and Jess knows for a fact that she spread a rumor around school that one of her friends was doing drugs. 

When Maddie got a question wrong in class Jess couldn't help but laugh. Maddie turned really red and called Jess an idiot. Before the teacher could step in, Jess pointed out that she wasn't the one failing geometry.

Jess has seen these posters everywhere. Maybe she should check out the website.

Maybe Jess can just submit a tip - she heard something about them being confidential.

Jess doesn't want to get anyone in trouble, but justice has to be served. That night she uses the website to submit a tip. Jess breathes a sigh of relief and hopes that this will sort everything out! 

[[The End!->ending14]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="69" name="dont use it" tags="" position="1476,2051">It's probably easier to just talk to an administrator. Jess walks into the office and shares what's been going on with Mr. Grant.

He says he's very concerned with what Jess showed him and promises to make sure everything gets sorted out. Jess feels pretty good. She knows she did the right thing.

[[The End!->ending14]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="70" name="Delete any negative posts" tags="" position="2735,1768">Jess usually doesn't post anything questionable, but she wants to double check to make sure. It would be really lame to get denied because of a bad post. Jess scrolls through all of her posts - some bring up great memories, but a lot of her photos and posts from middle school are just embarrassing. It really seems like she had an unhealthy obsession with Harry Styles.

After a half hour of editing her online reputation Jess feels satisfied. Her posts are great - her instagram account is an awesome digital portfolio. She goes online and fills out the art association application! 

[[The End!->ending12]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="71" name="post more art" tags="" position="2956,1720">It couldn't hurt to add more content. Jess takes some pictures of work she hasn't shown anyone before and posts them. Her social media accounts are becoming a really cool digital portfolio. 

Jess feels really confident that she can get in - she starts the application process and is pleased that the hardwork she put into cultivating a positive digital presence will pay off.

[[The End!->ending13]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="72" name="text her" tags="" position="3180,920">Jess is now getting a little worried. She [[texts->maddietext]] Maddie to apologize. She meets Maddie at a coffee shop. Something must be really wrong because Maddie is not nearly as mean as she usually is. 

They actually have a great conversation. They eventually get to the topic of why Maddie is such a jerk to everyone. As usual, Maddie avoids the question, but it later comes out that there's something serious going on for her. 

She was sexting with her boyfriend, but now that they're broken up, he keeps threatening to expose her. This is terrible! even Maddie doesn't deserve that kind of stress.

What should Jess do?
[[Suggest doing the same thing to him]]
[[Suggest going to the police]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="73" name="ignore her" tags="" position="3610,870">Maddie isn't there the next day either. In English class Jess gets called to the office. Jess's heart is pounding. What could be going on? Jess is a good student who has hardly ever gotten in trouble at school. Mr. Grant, the school administrator, sits down and asks Jess if she has posted anything questionable online. What should Jess do?

Typical Maddie response. It does seem like she's open to talking, though. Maybe Jess will find out why she's being such an annoying person.

Maddie agrees that this might work. The two go to their different classes. Jess feels really good that she was able to give Maddie advice. She wonders if one day they'll be friends. Deep down Maddie isn't quite as bad as she seems. On the surface, though, she's obnoxious. 

That night Jess gets a [[text->exposed]] from Maddie. 

Ugh! I guess Jess's advice wasn't so great after all. Jess feels really bad for Maddie, especially since it was partially Jess's fault. How can Jess help her?

Maddie reports the inappropriate content on reddit. That weekend Jess goes with her to the police station to make a report. Maddie was really worried that she would get in trouble for taking pictures in the first place, but Jess assured her she would be fine. 

Luckily the pictures were removed quickly and the police at the station helped Maddie to file a report.

This is infuriating. How did Jess ever think that Ryan was cool? He's being a little sociopath.

She made a really bad mistake, but Ryan was actively trying to exploit and hurt her. Jess expected to get in trouble, but luckily everyone at the station was helpful.

Olivia is so good at calming Jess down. It was getting really bad in Jess's head - thankfully she's a lot calmer now.

Jess didn't make the best decisions, but in the end she made a really important one. When it comes to blackmail or threatened exposure, going to the police is a hard choice to make.

After school she flags the youtube video and fills out a report - hopefully the video will be taken down in a couple days. 

Jess also decides to see what other videos Ryan has uploaded - most of them are just vlog entries, but there's also a really [[cool one]]. 

Jess [[texts->art]] Ryan to see if he made the video.

Working with his friend would be awesome. Jess feels like their art styles really compliment one another.

Maybe Jess will send her a text and see if they can work together on a project!

Ryan's cousin is a really good artist. Jess would like to talk to her about her projects. In middle school she never had a group where she could talk about art. Maybe high shcool will be different.

Lots of good decisions were made here! Flagging a fight video is a great way to be an upstander. Plus, by exploring the internet in a safe way, Jess might have found a really cool opportunity.
